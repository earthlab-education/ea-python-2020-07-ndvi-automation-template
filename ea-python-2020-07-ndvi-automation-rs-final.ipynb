    "## Assignment Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "Your goal in this assignment is to create the most efficient and concise workflow that you can that allows for:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The code to scale if you added new sites or more time periods to the analysis.\n",
    "2. Someone else to understand your workflow.\n",
    "3. The LEAST and most efficient (i.e. runs fast) amount of code that completes the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HINTS\n",
    "\n",
    "* Remove values outside of the landsat valid range of values as specified in the metadata, as needed.\n",
    "* Keep any output files SEPARATE FROM input files. Outputs should be created in an outputs directory that is created in the code (if needed) and/or tested for.\n",
    "* It can help to create the plot and CSV first without cleaning the data to deal with cloud, so you can get a hang of the workflow.  Then, you can modify your workflow to include the cleaning of the data to deal with clouds. (There are tests throughout the notebook that can help you check the data!)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Assignment Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "Your submission to the GitHub repository should include:\n",
    "* This Jupyter Notebook file (.ipynb) with:\n",
    "    * The code to create a plot of mean NDVI across the year:\n",
    "        * NDVI on the x axis and formatted dates on the y for both NEON sites on one figure/axis object\n",
    "    * The **data should be cleaned to remove the influence of clouds**. See the [earthdatascience website for an example of what your plot might look like with and without removal of clouds](https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics-python/create-efficient-data-workflows/).\n",
    "* One output .csv file that has 3 columns - NDVI, Date and Site Name - with values for SJER and HARV.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your notebook should:\n",
    "* Have at least 2 well documented and well named functions with docstrings.\n",
    "* Include a Markdown cell at the top of the notebook that outlines the overall workflow using pseudocode (i.e. plain language, not code)\n",
    "* Include additional Markdown cells throughout the notebook to describe: \n",
    "    * the data that you used - and where it is from\n",
    "    * how data are being processing\n",
    "    * how the code is optimized to run fast and be more concise"

The ENSO period results in reduced precipitation in California. The precipitation data indicates that 2017 was an exceptionally dry and hot year and it is not a true representative of the normal vegetation growth in California. It is worth checking vegetation indices (NDVI) during La Nina seasons-a weather pattern with more than usual rainfall in the California, to obtain a real picture of vegetation growth and seasonality over both ENSO and La Nina seasons.

This plot would provide information on the long term trends and how climate change (rising temperature due to the increase in carbon dioxide) is affecting plant growth. There is an interesting paradox that high CO2 will increase photosynthesis. However, proponent of this hypothesis have not into account the impact of heat and availability of moisture/water during growing season. Plotting long term record of mean NDVI, temperature, and soil moisture will help to answer some of the climate related impacts on the vegetation.  \n",
